Project Description:
A game about the life of a dog owner... and the difficulties therein. Should be played by prospective dog owners.

Purpose:
This game is designed to be enjoyed but also educate prospective dog owners about the responsibilities and costs of owning a dog. Approximately 3.1 million dogs are surrendered each year in the US alone, most commonly due to negiligence or unpreparedness when adopting or purchasing a dog. This game hopes to enlighten Players about the things you need to consider when owning a dog such as feeding, walking, and taking it to the vet. It follows the simulation of a dog owner who is prompted with events that occur that the player must respond to. These events vary from rudimentary day-to-day interactions, such as you're dog has made a new friend at the dog park, to more severe diseases such as heartworm. This game is designed to mimic the randomness of daily life, showing users that money needs to always be saved in the event that your dog needs medical attention which proves costly. This game also serves to educate players to proper care for thier dog. It encourages players to walk their dog frequently, feed them high-quality food, and take them to the vet when they are exhibiting any symptoms. While this game should not serve as medical or life advice, it functions as a good guideline for how to responsibly take care of a dog while providing a stimulating player experience. This game has no true objective other than to assist your dog in living their best life, just as true dog ownership does. Our hope is this game will be able to make some impact on the number of dogs being surrended to shelters every year.
