*Requires python 3.10 or above*

The First Time You Play: From the root folder, type in 'sh CLICKME.sh' in a terminal window and press enter. This will download dependent python libraries and run the application.

For additional play-throughs, you can use the same command as above, or from the root folder type in 'python3 ./src/app.py' in a terminal window and press enter. This will skip the process of downloading dependent libraries.

Directory Contents:
Root folder (./): Contains docs/ and src/ sub directories as well as CLICKME.sh bash script

Documents(./docs/): Contains folders and files with dog information and research, images, and development process meeting notes.

Source Files(./src/): Contains static data libraries in /data/ sub directory, as well as the main source code files app.py, controller.py, and model.py.

Data (./src/data): Contains static data including dictionaries of shop items, afflictions, events, dog breeds. Also contains the scraper (scraper.py) used to gather the data.
